## 📝 Documentation Guidelines

### Creating New Documentation

1. **Choose the correct category** based on the document's primary purpose
2. **Use descriptive filenames** in kebab-case (e.g., `feature-name-plan.md`)
3. **Include frontmatter** with title, date, and author when appropriate
4. **Follow markdown best practices** for formatting and structure

### Updating Documentation

1. **Update in place** - modify existing docs rather than creating duplicates
2. **Add changelog entries** for significant updates
3. **Keep docs in sync** with implementation
4. **Archive outdated docs** to `09-temp/archive/` instead of deleting

### Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include code examples where helpful
- Add diagrams for complex concepts
- Link to related documentation
- Keep table of contents updated
- Version control all documentation
