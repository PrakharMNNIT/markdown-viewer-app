# Code & Architecture Review: Export Services

## 1. Code Review

### PDFService (PDF Export)
- **Status:** ⚠️ Resolved Rendering Issue
- **Issue:** The `html2pdf` library (specifically `html2canvas`) crashed when parsing modern CSS `color-mix()` functions used in the UI (Glassmorphism).
- **Fix:** Refactored `style.css` to use solid color variables (`var(--bg-secondary)`) instead of `color-mix()` for elements involved in the export context (Buttons).
- **Quality:**
  - ✅ Clean separation of config (`buildHtml2PdfConfig`) and execution.
  - ✅ Robust validation of user inputs (margins, page size).
  - ⚠️ Dependency on global `html2pdf` (should be modular, but acceptable for this architecture).

### HTMLService (HTML Export)
- **Status:** ✅ NEW Implementation
- **Issue:** Previous implementation was monolithic (inside `script.js`) and produced broken HTML (missing math styles, missing syntax highlighting dependencies).
- **Fix:** Created dedicated `HTMLService.js`.
  - Injects `katex.min.css` (CDN) for Math support.
  - Injects `prism-tomorrow.min.css` (CDN) for Code highlighting.
  - Injects Theme CSS properly.
- **Quality:**
  - ✅ Service-based architecture.
  - ✅ Generates standalone HTML blobs.

## 2. Architectural Review

### Service Layer
- **Pattern:** The application uses a "Service Class" pattern (`PDFService`, `MermaidService`, `HTMLService`) instantiated in the main controller (`script.js`).
- **Verdict:** Good. This keeps logic out of the global scope and allows for easier testing/mocking.
- **Recommendation:** `script.js` acts as a text-heavy "God Controller". Future refactoring should split `script.js` into `EditorController`, `PreviewController`, and `ToolbarController`.

### CSS / Styling
- **Architecture:** CSS Variables (`:root`) used for Theming.
- **Issue:** Modern CSS (`color-mix`) caused compatibility issues with legacy tools (`html2canvas`).
- **Lesson:** When building "Export to PDF" features that rely on DOM parsing, avoid bleeding-edge CSS in exportable elements.

## 3. UI/UX Review

### PDF Export
- **Experience:** ⭐️ Premium.
- **Features:** Live Preview, Custom Margins, Page Size, Font Scale.
- **Feedback:** The glassmorphism and animations in the modal are visually pleasing.

### HTML Export
- **Experience:** 😐 Functional.
- **Features:** "Click to Download".
- **Feedback:** Lacks a "Preview" or configuration (e.g., "Exclude CSS?").
- **Improvement:** Could add a simple modal to choose "Self-contained (Base64 images)" vs "Linked".

## Summary of Findings
- **Critical Fix:** `color-mix` CSS removed to unblock PDF generation.
- **New Feature:** `HTMLService` ensures exported files render Math and Code correctly.
