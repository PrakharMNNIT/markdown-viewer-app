## **📁 Documentation Structure Rules**

**CRITICAL: Never create documentation in random locations!**

All documentation must follow this professional structure:

```
docs/
├── 01-requirements/     # Requirements, specs, feature plans
├── 02-architecture/     # Architecture diagrams, design decisions, ADRs
├── 03-database/         # Database schemas, migrations, data models
├── 04-ui-ux/           # UI/UX designs, mockups, wireframes, prototypes
├── 05-implementation/   # Implementation guides, refactoring plans
├── 06-security/        # Security models, threat analysis, compliance
├── 07-validation/      # Testing strategies, QA plans, validation docs
├── 08-deployment/      # Deployment guides, CI/CD, operations
└── 09-temp/            # Temporary docs, work-in-progress notes
```

**Rules:**

1. **NEVER** create documentation files in the project root
2. **ALWAYS** place new documentation in the appropriate `docs/` subdirectory
3. **UPDATE** existing documentation in place - do not duplicate
4. Use clear, descriptive filenames: `feature-name-plan.md`, not `doc1.md`
5. Archive outdated docs to `docs/09-temp/archive/` - don't delete immediately

## **🏗️ Memory Bank Overview**

Every project maintains a `memory-bank/` directory containing Markdown files that I read **in full at the start of every session**.

> Rule #1: Keep all core files current and accurate
>
> **Rule #2:** Document decisions, not just implementations
>
> **Rule #3:** Maintain production-grade engineering standards at all times

## **🎯 Operational Philosophy**

> "No shortcuts. No regressions. No lost context."

Cline's Memory Bank exists to ensure **continuity, quality, and craftsmanship**.

After every session reset, I must reconstruct the complete mental model of the system and continue engineering **as if I never left** — without compromising on:

- ✅ **Code quality and readability**
- ✅ **Security and privacy**
- ✅ **Testing discipline and coverage**
- ✅ **Performance and scalability**
- ✅ **Documentation completeness**
- ✅ **Architectural integrity**
- ✅ **Operational excellence**

### **Core Beliefs:**

1. **Excellence is non-negotiable** — mediocre code costs more long-term than doing it right the first time
2. **Context is power** — well-maintained memory enables senior-level engineering at machine speed
3. **Standards prevent decay** — explicit guidelines prevent gradual quality erosion
4. **Documentation is investment** — future you (and your team) will thank present you
5. **Technical debt is optional** — with discipline and systems, zero debt is achievable

---

## **🚀 Success Metrics**

A well-maintained Memory Bank enables:

- ✅ **Zero onboarding time** for resumed work
- ✅ **Consistent quality** across all sessions
- ✅ **Architectural coherence** over time
- ✅ **Rapid context switching** between projects
- ✅ **Traceable decision history**
- ✅ **Measurable progress** against goals
- ✅ **Institutional knowledge** that survives reset

---

---

### **Best Practices**

1. **Be Specific:** Describe _what_ and _why_, not _how_
   - ❌ `fix: update code`
   - ✅ `fix(parser): handle edge case in JSON parsing for null values`
2. **Use Imperative Mood:** Write as if giving commands
   - ❌ `Added new feature`
   - ✅ `Add user profile feature`
3. **Keep First Line Under 72 Characters:** Ensures readability in all Git tools
4. **Reference Issues:** Link commits to issue tracking
   - `Closes #123`
   - `Fixes #456`
   - `Relates to #789`
5. **Document Breaking Changes:** Always use `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
6. **Scope Appropriately:** Use consistent scope names
   - `feat(api): ...`
   - `fix(database): ...`
   - `docs(readme): ...`
7. **One Logical Change Per Commit:** Atomic commits are easier to review and revert

---

### **Automation & Enforcement**

**Recommended Tools:**

1. [**Husky**](https://typicode.github.io/husky) – Git hooks management
2. [**commitlint**](https://commitlint.js.org/) – Commit message linting
3. [**Commitizen**](https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/) – Interactive commit CLI

- Include performance metrics for optimization commits

---

### **Integration with CI/CD**

**Automated Workflows:**

```yaml
# Example GitHub Action for commit linting
name: Lint Commits
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  commitlint:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
      - uses: wagoid/commitlint-github-action@v5
```

**Automated Changelog Generation:**

- Use `conventional-changelog` to generate `CHANGELOG.md`
- Automate semantic versioning based on commit types
- Trigger releases on merged PRs with specific commit patterns

---

**💡 Final Reminder:**

Standardized commits are not bureaucracy — they're **infrastructure for clarity**. Good commit messages are documentation that explains _why_ the code exists, not just _what_ changed. Future developers (including yourself) will thank you for the context.

---

**By adopting Conventional Commits**, your team maintains a clean, descriptive, and automated commit history — improving collaboration, enabling better tooling, and ensuring long-term maintainability. Combined with the Memory Bank protocol, this creates a comprehensive system for engineering excellence that survives across time and team changes.
