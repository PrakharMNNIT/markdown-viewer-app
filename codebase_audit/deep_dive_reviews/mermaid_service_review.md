## ⚠️ Issues & Observations

### 1. ⚙️ Massive Configuration Object (Line 96)
```javascript
themeVariables: { ... 100+ lines ... }
```
**Critique:** You are explicitly mapping every single Mermaid variable (60+) to your own CSS variables.
- **Pros:** Total control over the look.
- **Cons:** **High Coupling**. If Mermaid v12 changes its variable names (e.g., `primaryColor` -> `mainColor`), your integration breaks or looks wrong.
- **Suggestion:** Consider whether mapped sets (Primary, Secondary, Tertiary) are sufficient, or if this granular control is truly business-critical.

### 2. 🔢 Hardcoded Font configurations (Lines 99, 100)
```javascript
fontFamily: '-apple-system, ...',
fontSize: '16px',
```
**Critique:** You are hardcoding fonts in JS.
- **Issue:** If the user changes the font in `style.css`, the diagrams won't match the rest of the app.
- **Fix:** Use `getCssVariable('--font-family')` and `getCssVariable('--font-size-base')`.

### 3. 📉 Missing Debounce/Cancellation
**Critique:** `MermaidService.render` is async.
- **Scenario:** User types fast. `render('id', 'graph TD...')` is called 5 times in 200ms.
- **Result:** You might have 5 parallel rendering processes competing.
- **Fix:** Implement a `Cancellation` mechanism or rely on the Controller to debounce calls (which `script.js` currently fails to do properly).

### 4. 🎭 Theme Detection Logic (Line 45)
```javascript
function isLightTheme(bgColor) { ... }
```
**Critique:** Clever use of luminance calculation!
- **Positive:** This is a nice "Senior Dev" touch. It ensures that even if I pick a weird Custom Theme color (e.g., bright yellow background), Mermaid will likely pick the correct "Dark/Light" base mode.
- **Refactor:** Move `getRelativeLuminance` to `src/js/utils/colorHelpers.js`. It is a pure utility function and might be useful elsewhere (e.g., checking text contrast accessibility).

## 🏁 Verdict
**Grade: B+**
The logic is solid, but the coupling to Mermaid's specific variable names is a risk. It's "Enterprise Grade" in the sense that it handles everything, but "Enterprise Grade" also means "Heavy maintenance".
