  "hld": "The application follows a client-side monolithic architecture with pure vanilla JavaScript, CSS variables for theming, and no backend. It uses a \"Service Layer\" pattern to isolate business logic (Mermaid, Prism) from UI, and an \"Observer Pattern\" for theme changes. Data is persisted solely via browser `localStorage`. Security relies on client-side sanitization (Marked.js) and no external data transmission.",
  "lld": "The codebase is organized into modular layers: `UI` (HTML), `Application` (script.js controller), `Core` (StorageManager, ThemeManager), `Services` (MermaidService, PrismService), and `Utils` (HTML/Color helpers). The `ThemeManager` handles 12 built-in themes + custom themes using CSS variables. `MermaidService` and `PrismService` wrap external libraries with lazy initialization and error handling. `script.js` acts as the entry point, treating other modules as injected dependencies.",
