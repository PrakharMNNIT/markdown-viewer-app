# 📦 Phase 6: Final Deliverables

## 1. Audit Summary
The `markdown-viewer-app` is a capable, feature-rich static web application. It delivers on its core promise of "no set-up" markdown viewing. However, it carries significant **Technical Debt** in its control structure (`script.js`) and a **Critical Security Vulnerability** that makes it unsafe for handling untrusted files.

## 2. Test Strategy Outline
To ensure quality during the proposed refactoring, we recommend the following test strategy:

*   **Unit Tests (Vitest):**
    *   Cover `StorageManager` (Data persistence).
    *   Cover `ThemeManager` (Logic correctness).
    *   Cover `Sanitization` (Verify malicious inputs are stripped).
*   **Integration Tests:**
    *   Verify `MermaidService` correctly loads config from `ThemeManager`.
*   **Manual Acceptance Tests:**
    *   "The Scroll Sync Test": Verify proportional scrolling in split view.
    *   "The Theme Switch Test": Verify no "flash of white" or broken diagrams on switch.

## 3. Stakeholder Slide-Deck Outline

**Slide 1: Title**
*   **audit Report: Markdown Viewer Pro**
*   *Status: Critical Issues Found*

**Slide 2: The Good**
*   Zero-config, runs everywhere.
*   Modular Service layer (Mermaid, Prism, PDF) is well-designed.
*   Excellent Documentation.

**Slide 3: The Bad (Critical Findings)**
*   **Security:** XSS Vulnerability (Malicious MD files can hack users).
*   **Stability:** Race conditions cause occasional rendering glitches.

**Slide 4: The Ugly (Tech Debt)**
*   `script.js` is a "God Object" (1300+ lines).
*   Hard to maintain or extend without accidental breakage.

**Slide 5: The Plan**
*   **Immediate:** Fix Security.
*   **Next:** Refactor Controller.
*   **Future:** TypeScript & Bundling.

**Slide 6: Approval Request**
*   Requesting approval to proceed with Phase A (Security Fixes).
